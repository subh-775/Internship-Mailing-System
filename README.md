# Internship-Mailing-System

Here I've built an automated email system using Python to streamline personalized communication with multiple institutes or organizations. This system pulls recipient details from a CSV file, generates customized email content based on a template, and sends the emails via Gmail's SMTP server with optional attachments (like resumes,letters). Youâ€™ve also incorporated error handling to manage issues such as file not found errors, invalid email addresses, and SMTP authentication failures. Your work aims to efficiently manage outreach, such as internship requests or professional collaboration emails, while minimizing manual effort.


Few work left is in progress will be committed soon...
